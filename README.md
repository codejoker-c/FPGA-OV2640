# FPGA-OV2640
This project uses verilog to implement interaction with OV2640 camera, Bluetooth slave module and VGA display on FPGA.
## What did this project do?
This project uses the OV2640 camera to capture image information, use the FPGA board for image buffering and processing image information, and then display the image on the display in real time through VGA. Through Bluetooth, you can use a mobile phone to remotely control different processing methods to display different Type of filter mode. The selected mode is displayed on the FPGA board through a digital tube.
